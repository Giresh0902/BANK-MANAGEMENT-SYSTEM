## ðŸŽ¯ OOP Concepts Used
- Encapsulation â†’ Data members (e.g., `balance`, `pin`) are private and accessed via methods.  
- Abstraction â†’ The system hides complex logic behind simple methods (`deposit()`, `withdrawal()`).  
- Inheritance â†’ Different classes extend functionalities from other classes where needed.  
- Polymorphism â†’ Overloaded constructors are used for creating accounts with different details.

## ðŸ“¦ Package Structure
The project is well-structured using **Java Packages** to organize different functionalities:
- `ACCOUNT` â†’ Manages account-related operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.  
- `ACNGEN` â†’ Handles account number and PIN generation logic.  
- `INDEXPACK` â†’ Provides utilities for finding account indices.  


## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core Programming Language)  
- **OOP Concepts** (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism)  
- **Java Packages** (For better code organization)  
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)
